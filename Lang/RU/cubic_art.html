				<p class="TITLE"><b>Cubic Art</b></p>
				<div>
					<p class="TEXT">
						Cubic art is an artistic movement that was created by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. It utilises multiple
                        geometric shapes to create depictions of characters. It was largely popular throughout the early 20th century.
                        The “first era of cubism” was in 1905-1911, in which the art was created as depictions of subjects from multiple
                        viewing angles at once, which would create a fractured, multi-dimensional effect.
						<br><br>
						The “second era of cubism” (~1912 - Present) was quite similar to the original, however now Picasso and Braque had
                        begun to incorporate words to the art. Orphic cubism is a movement centered on the Puteaux collective. This branch
                        of cubism embraced brighter hues of colours and augmented abstraction.
						<br><br>
						World War One greatly affected Cubism as an art movement for a number of artists including Braque and others who
                        influenced the previous generations of the art form. By 1917, Picasso had returned to the world of realistic art,
                        however his refusal to conform to the art standards meant that Cubism could be found in some works throughout the
                        years in pieces such as The Three Musicians (1921) and The Weeping Woman (1937).
						<br><br>
						Cubist painters rejected the concept that art should copy nature, or be a true representation of the world. Instead,
                        they wanted to emphasise the two-dimensionality of the canvas that was available. The liberating idea of this art
                        form managed to reach its way to other countries like Germany, Russia, Italy and The United Kingdom.
						<br><br>
						The meaning of cubism has morphed slightly throughout the ages, however the art format is still about twisting the
                        way we see reality. In modern day art pieces, it is more common that cubism will mean almost minimalism. Cubic art
                        is still very much present in the modern day through digital art, and through this medium, it lives on.<br>
