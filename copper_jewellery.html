                <div>
                    <p class="TEXT">
                        For thousands of years, copper has been used for medicinal purposes. An Ancient Egyptian medical book named
                        “The Smith Papyrus” suggests that copper is a remedy to sterilise chest wounds and clean water to make it
                        suitable for drinking. Nowadays, copper bracelets are still quite popular. One of the main reasons being that
                        the ancient Greeks' use of copper bracelets to treat arthritis has influenced the (many) later generations to
                        continue with this “trend”. Copper has been demonstrated to be an essential micronutrient for our blood, muscles
                        and joints. Large doses of copper orally can lead to many negative side effects, however the use of a bracelet
                        is much below the threshold that would be required for any of these side effects.
                        <br><br>
                        However, the Greeks may have used this method, but there is no scientific or clinical evidence. A 2013 study
                        fulfilled by Dr. Stewart Richmond and then reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D shows us that there is “no good
                        evidence that they reduce pain and/or inflammation” and that here is “strong evidence they do not have any clinical
                        effect.” Whether the people using these copper bracelets were experiencing the placebo effect, or they just were
                        more luck than others, we may never know. Dr. Richmond says that “people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may
                        be better off saving their money, or spending it on complementary interventions such as dietary fish oils which
                        have far better evidence for effectiveness.”
                        <br><br>
                        Another thing the Greeks believed is that copper could help with cardiovascular illnesses such as copper deficiency.
                        Good news, however, is that science shows that there are strong links between copper bracelets and a lower blood
                        pressure, therefore eliminating the issues bought along with cardiovascular illnesses that cause high blood pressure.
                        <br><br>
                        Many people still make art out of copper. For example, an indie business named “Aura Luna” produces products of all
                        sorts, and copper and crystal jewelry is one of those many products. According to them, copper is a material that
                        is easy to melt down and recycle, which could be something that can help our global warming crisis. They also say
                        that it is a good conductor of energy, and that is why you find it commonly in wires in your house, such as your
                        earphone cables and plugs. Copper is also a durable substance that doesn’t deteriorate, meaning that jewlers that put
                        their effort and time into making copper jewelry can rest assured that their products won't break within a few minutes
                        of use.
                        <br><br>
                        Many modernists like to work with copper. It is easy to mass-produce items using copper, especially in older times such
                        as the 1940s, ‘50s and ‘60s. Artist Jerry Fels and his brother in law Kurt Freiler not only made copper jewelry but also
                        developed a coating for it named “Copron” which would eliminate the pesky fingerprints that would be left on the material,
                        and also limits tarnishing and defacing from oils that are commonly found in fingerprints.
                        <br><br>
                        Copper contains chemicals that cause enzymatic chemical reactions which positively impact the body's own chemistry. The
                        copper must come into contact with skin for this to happen, and it must be in contact with the oils and acids on the skin,
                        therefore coated copper won't provide these health benefits. When the copper is in direct contact, the micro-nutrients found
                        inside it will enter the bloodstream as copper salt. It is important to use pure copper which is defined as 99.9% copper,
                        and trace elements of tin and zinc. This has not been medically disputed.
                        <br><br>
                        Copper also possesses anti-oxidants which prevent free ions from raising toxicity within the body, which causes the look of
                        aging. It does this by improving the density of elastic fibers. In doing this, copper slows the aging process not just on
                        the outside on your skin, but on the inside meaning you don't just look younger, you physically feel younger.
                        <br><br>
                        Another amazing health benefit of copper is that it is antibacterial. Copper can destroy the growth of microbes, fungi and
                        bacteria (this includes E Coli). Using copper can widely improve the immune system, prevent infections, improve wound healing
                        and speed up the healing process of tissues. The U.S EPA actually finds that copper is the only solid material that can kill
                        bacteria that pose a threat to human health.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the downsides is that copper isn’t that affordable. For example, Jen Lesea’s range of copper and silver products can
                        cost in the hundreds. Jen is an indie designer, and when she was a girl, she was fascinated by collecting rocks and sea shells
                        along the coast. When she designs, she takes these traces close to heart. She taught herself smithing, which is amazing! It really
                        goes to show that anyone can learn anything at any age if you put effort into it.
                        <br><br>
                        Will Nevins-Alderfer is another example of an amazing example of someone who had put the time and effort into learning smithing
                        and manages to create some beautiful products with it. Will was intrigued by the effects of copper after his Metalsmithing
                        professor at Earlham College taught him about something called Mokume-gane, which is a hollowware made using an ancient Japanese
                        fusing technique. In an interview with the Copper Development Association Inc, he says that “It is super unique! There is only one
                        other guy in Maine that I have noticed doing this”.<br>
